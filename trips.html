            <p><b>Classic & Quiet, Fall Colour Algonquin.</b>
            <p>Late September/Early October 2023, 10 days on trip.</p>
            <p>For a non-Canadian Guide, Wilderness Canoe probably know the interior of Algonquin better than most. We have traveled
            across, around and over a LOT of it...</p>
            <p>Easy access from Toronto makes this area ideal for a first, second or third time visit. Algonquin, once across the first
            or second portage has a beautiful interior and opportunity to see much of the local fauna. October should be starting to
            colour up well also, although the 'peak' Fall Colour can never be guaranteed. No bugs, few people, reasonable weather -
            it's a great time to visit.</p>
            <p>Wilderness Canoe have well established connections with the pre-eminent Outfitter in the region. Great equipment, great
            food, great staff, great trip support. Algonquin Outfitters</p>
            <p><b>Â£2400.00/p/p</b> (based on 4 persons) - inc.<em> Outfitting, Food, Guiding.</em></p>
