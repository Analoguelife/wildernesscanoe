          <h4 class="trip_title">Classic & Quiet, Fall Colour Algonquin.</h4>
          <p>Late September/Early October 2023, 10 days on trip.</p>
          <p>
            For a non-Canadian Guide, Wilderness Canoe probably know the interior
            of Algonquin better than most. We have traveled across, around and
            over a LOT of it...
          </p>
          <p>
            Easy access from Toronto makes this area ideal for a first, second or
            third time visit. Algonquin, once across the first or second portage
            has a beautiful interior and opportunity to see much of the local
            fauna. October should be starting to colour up well also, although the
            'peak' Fall Colour can never be guaranteed. No bugs, few people,
            reasonable weather - it's a great time to visit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wilderness Canoe have well established connections with the
            pre-eminent Outfitter in the region. Great equipment, great food,
            great staff, great trip support.

          <h4 class="trip_title">Great Slave Lake, Pikes Portage & the Thelon River.</h4>
          <p>July - August 2025 and/or 2026. Up to 60 days on trip.</p>
          <p>This could be the trip of a lifetime for you. Classic beyond the tree-line expedition paddling
            incorporating BIG lakes, historical portages, true wilderness rivers. The <b>Barrenlands</b> at their
            finest.</p>
          <blockquote class="bq1">
            <p>We had to make use of a chain of lakes, eight in number, lying to the south of the
              stream. This is by
              far the prettiest part of the countr that I saw in the North, and it was looking its best under the bright
              sunshine that continued till we reached the fort. Scattering timber, spruce and birch, clothed the sloping
              banks down to the sandy shores of the lakes; berries of many kinds grew in profusions; the portages were
              short and down hill; and caribou were walking the ridges and swimming the lakes in every direction. A
              perfect northern fairyland it was, and it seemed hard to believe that winter and want could ever penetrate
              here, but on the shore of a lovely blue lake Pierre the Fool pointed out a spot where the last horrors of
              death and cannibalism had been enacted within his memory.</p><cite> Warburton Pike, The Barren Ground of
              Northern Canada, 1890.</cite>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The Thelon is a big, shallow, clear-water river with a strong current but very few rapids. It's the
            largest river on the tundra, by far the easiest to canoe, and easily the most magnificent. The scale of the
            country is huge! You feel very small and insignificant in this big landscape that keeps changing every day.
            The Thelon Oasis is legendary as a wildlife paradise, long known to Chipewyan Dene as "God's country" as
            "the birthplace of animals" and when the world was created as "the place where God began".</p>
          <p>While paddling experience is an asset, this trip is suitable for whitewater/tripping canoe novices –
            with the support of our experienced guide. So whitewater experience is certainly an asset but not a
            prerequisite. However participants should be good flat-water canoeists, particularly when in the stern.</p>

            This is likely to be a fairly challenging trip in some exposed
            terrain, therefore participants should not only be in good health, but
            also fairly self-sufficient in camping and travelling skills having
            undertook some of the more ameniable Scottish trips available such as
            a Rannoch Moor crossing or exploration of Assynt. Confident canoe
            skills required. We shall be paddling tandem throughout.

            The majestic Torne River is the largest of Sweden’s national rivers and one of the last untouched water
            ecosystems in Europe. Originating from lake Torneträsk, the Torne river is fed by meltwater from the ancient
            mountains of Abisko National Park. It winds its way from the mountains, past Kiruna, Jukkasjärvi towards the
            border of Finnish Lapland before reaching Haparanda where it unites with the Gulf of Bothnia.
