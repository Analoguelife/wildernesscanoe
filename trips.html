      <h3>Trips & Expeditions</h3>
      <h2>Canada</h2>
      <h4 class="trip_title">Classic & Quiet, Fall Colour Algonquin.</h4>
      <p>Late September/Early October 2023, 10 days on trip.</p>
      <p>
        For a non-Canadian Guide, Wilderness Canoe probably know the interior
        of Algonquin better than most. We have traveled across, around and
        over a LOT of it...
      </p>
      <p>
        Easy access from Toronto makes this area ideal for a first, second or
        third time visit. Algonquin, once across the first or second portage
        has a beautiful interior and opportunity to see much of the local
        fauna. October should be starting to colour up well also, although the
        'peak' Fall Colour can never be guaranteed. No bugs, few people,
        reasonable weather - it's a great time to visit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wilderness Canoe have well established connections with the
        pre-eminent Outfitter in the region. Great equipment, great food,
        great staff, great trip support.

        This is likely to be a fairly challenging trip in some exposed
        terrain, therefore participants should not only be in good health, but
        also fairly self-sufficient in camping and travelling skills having
        undertook some of the more ameniable Scottish trips available such as
        a Rannoch Moor crossing or exploration of Assynt. Confident canoe
        skills required. We shall be paddling tandem throughout.
