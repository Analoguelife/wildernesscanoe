      <p class="lead"><b>Wilderness Canoe</b> are based in Scotland, although our expeditions focus mostly on
        <b>Canada</b> more particularly Ontario. Wilderness Canoe have been running trips to various locations within
        Ontario since 2016, and in Scotland since 2003.
      </p>
      <p>Since Covid, we made a return to both Temagami and Algonquin in 2022 with clients. During 2023, we were
        originally going to be based in France for a while and this would have impacted the available time for us to run
        trips this year. However life changes and we are now in a position to commence trips during the period - mid
        August until early October.</p>

      <h3>Expeditions</h3>
      <p>I have thought about grading Wilderness Canoe trips... Maybe on a scale of:
      <ul>
        <li>Good chance of survival...</li>
        <li>Chance of survival slim...</li>
        <li>Survival uncertain at best...</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Ultimately though, the participants mindset, overall resilience, passion for adventure are key on all trips.
        Because I adjust each trip to suit those on it and because those on it, wish it - every trip is successful in
        its intentions. To have an Adventure with like minded folks, to return with a story to tell, to wish for more of
        the same.</p>
      <p>So, a grading system is not really neccesary.</p>
      <h4>Canada</h4>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Temagami</li>
        <li>Algonquin</li>
        <li>Crown Land / Nastawgan Routes</li>
        <li><em>Where do you want to go..?</em></li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Expeditions are based loosely around various trip durations. 10 days, 14 days or longer bespoke trips.</p>
      <p>Almost all itineries are more traditional journey's from lake to lake utilising interlinking portage trails.
        These journey's are as difficult, easy, long or relaxed as you want them to be. Generally all trips will spend
        time journeing for a few days with either a full rest day or a short day every few days.</p>
      <p>Unless the weather is extremely inclement or there is a Fire Ban in force, all cooking is done on open fires.
        Food is either fresh for the first few days or dehydrated meals specially prepared by the outfitters. There is
        an option to buy/pack our own food also.</p>
      <p>Once you arrive at the outfitters all equipment, food and shuttles are provided in the final costs. Travel to
        and from the point of entry into Canada and the outfitters plus any associated costs is at the expense of each
        client.</p>
      <h4>Scotland</h4>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Western Isles &amp; Outer Hebrides</li>
        <li>Other Areas</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Expeditions are between 4 and 10 days, or bespoke.</p>
      <p>The scottish trips tend to be a bit more challenging overall. Quite often heading into areas that are less
        frequented by canoeists, involving sea crossings or coastal journey's along committing shorelines, rounding
        exposed headlands. There is a strong possibility of having to sit out the weather or sea state, even making a
        route reversal. This is where the adventure though lays.</p>
      <h3>Costs</h3>
      <p>Costs of each trip are dependent on the location and duration, a typical outfitting cost in Canada is approx
        CDN$140/person/day - (Equipment, Food, Shuttles). Costs for trips in Scotland & France take into account that
        participants are self-sufficient in all their requirements. Guiding costs are Â£250/day/group, this cost is fixed
        (until 2025) and shared amongst <b>ALL</b> group participants, plus <b>ALL</b> Guide expenses (this will be
        notified to participants).</p>
      <em>Wilderness Canoe aim to be fair in pricing. We want folks to be able to experience places without
        breaking the bank. <p>Therefore:<br /> Wilderness Canoe keep external costs to their actual cost to
          us;<br />Wilderness Canoe
          charge a fair rate for our services;<br /> Wilderness Canoe are transparent with any expenses passed onto
          clients.</p></em>
