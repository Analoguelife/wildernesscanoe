        <p class="lead"><b>Wilderness Canoe</b> are based in Scotland, although our expeditions focus solely on <b>Canada</b> more particularly in Ontario.  Wilderness Canoe have been running trips to various locations within Ontario since 2016.</p>
        <p>Since Covid, we made a return to both Temagami and Algonquin in 2022 with clients. During 2023, we were originally going to be based in France for a while and this would have impacted the available time for us to run trips this year. However life changes and we are now in a position to commence trips during the period - mid August until early October.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in organising a trip for yourself or a group of friends, then - <a href="mailto:matt@m-thompson.co.uk?subject=Canada 2023" class="buttonClass"></a></p>
        <h3>Expeditions</h3>
        <p>Expeditions are based loosely around various trip durations. 10 days, 14 days or longer bespoke trips.</p>
        <p>Almost all itineries are more traditional journeys from lake to lake utilising interlinking portage trails. These journey's are as difficult, long or relaxed as you want them to be. Generally all trips will spend time journeing for a few days with either a full rest day or a short day every fourth day.</p>
        <p>Unless the weather is extremely inclement or there is a Fire Ban in force, all cooking is done on open fires. Food is either fresh for the first few days or dehydrated meals specially prepared by the outfitters. There is an option to buy/pack our own food also.</p>
        <p>Once you arrive at the outfitters all equipment, food and shuttles are provided in the final costs. Travel to and from the point of entry into Canada and the outfitters plus any associated costs is at the expense of each client.</p>
        <h3>Costs</h3>
        <p>Costs of each trip are dependent on the location and duration, a typical outfitting cost is approx CDN$120/person/day - (Equipment, Food, Shuttles). Guiding costs are approx Â£250/day/group (this cost is fixed and shared amongst ALL group participants) plus ALL Guide expenses, this will be notified to participants.</p>
        <p>Outfitting does not include Alchohol or additional 'treats'.</p>
        <p>Accommodation for one night at each side of the trip can be booked if required</p>
        <p>Personal clothing, footwear etc is not included in Outfitting, a <b>Kit List</b> will be provided on booking.</p>
