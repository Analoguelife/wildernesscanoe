      <h3>Expeditions</h3>
      <p>Our expeditions focus solely on <b>Canada</b>. More particularly on Ontario.  Wilderness Canoe have been running trips to various places within Ontario now since 2016.</p>
      <p>Since Covid, we made a return to both Temagami and Algonquin in 2022 with clients. During 2023, we were originally going to be based in France for a while and this would have impacted the available time for us to run trips this year. However life chages and we are now in a position to commence trips during the period - late August until early October.</p>
      <p>If you are interested in organising a trip for yourself or a group of friends, then - <a href="mailto:matt@m-thompson.co.uk?subject=Canada 2023">Get In Touch</a></p>
