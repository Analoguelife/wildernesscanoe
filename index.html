      <p class="lead"><b>Wilderness Canoe</b> are based in Scotland, although our expeditions focus mostly on
        <b>Canada</b> more particularly Ontario. Wilderness Canoe have been running trips to various locations within
        Ontario since 2016, and in Scotland since 2003.
      </p>
      <p>Since Covid, we made a return to both Temagami and Algonquin in 2022 with clients. During 2023, we were
        originally going to be based in France for a while and this would have impacted the available time for us to run
        trips this year. However life changes and we are now in a position to commence trips during the period - mid
        August until early October.</p>

      <h3 id="about">About</h3>
      <p>For those with a vision to be in wild spaces where reflection, observation of the surrounding world,
        cooperation in
        learning and helping each other along the canoeing journey can be experienced. We challenge clients to explore
        and
        question their canoeing skills, their knowledge of the world around them, and their relationship to canoeing.
      </p>
      <p>Wilderness Canoe hope to encourage a return to a deeper appreciation of traditional values believing this to be
        a vital
        part of true education/experience/exploration, and thus help to nourish the human spirit in an impoverished age.
        Through
        this exploration, you will achieve a strong sense of personal accomplishment and growth under our relaxed
        supervision.</p>
      <p>Learn new skills, Experience true nature, Advance to higher levels; no one offers the same diversity and depth.
      </p>
      <p>Wilderness Canoe journeys are contextual, we believe people need to experience activities, nature, wildness and
        ourselves to reconnect, stay connected and thrive.</p>
      <p>Contextual Learning allows for an environment where we can explore our surroundings, gain connection through
        involvement
        and multi-sensory feelings; practise skills within context; return to simple pleasures and a slower pace of
        life. Your
        experience will be in this fully participatory expedition environment; let us help you achieve your aspirations
        and
        dreams.</p>
      <p>Wilderness Canoe have now led innumerable trips here in the UK; coached at symposia in the UK, France and
        Canada;
        led trips to Norway, Sweden, France and Canada as well as in Scotland.</p>
      <p>Matt T has been in this outdoor adventure, education world now for almost 40 years. Working professionally all
        that time. That world has changed so much over those years for him. After deciding back in about 2007 to begin
        shaping the direction he was heading in to be more about canoeing and expeditioning, Matt ultimately recognised
        he had a 'mental health problem' in 2015, this resulted in taking significant time away from the areas of life
        that were negatively affecting him. This led to Matt deciding to only offer and participate in trips that he
        would want to do, hopefully others want to also.</p>
      <p>There is so much on offer, so many choices, if you want to learn, explore or have fun whether in the UK or
        elsewhere. Wilderness
        Canoe offer all of the above in a totally unpressured setting. It's unpressured because each trip is built
        around those participating - the destination, the outcomes are what we all want, the methodology and intensity
        in achieving them
        are what we have all agreed upon.</p>
      <p>We think of ourselves as the Canoeists Canoer. Spending time somewhere that we have used the canoe to access,
        sitting watching the stars or the sunrise, smelling the waft of fresh coffee brewing on the campfire, slowing
        down, reflecting and relishing the disconnect from your everyday
        world and the new found connectedness to this world.</p>
      <h3>Expeditions</h3>
      <p>I have thought about grading Wilderness Canoe trips... Maybe on a scale of:
      <ul>
        <li>Good chance of survival...</li>
        <li>Chance of survival slim...</li>
        <li>Survival uncertain at best...</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Ultimately though, the participants mindset, overall resilience, passion for adventure are key on all trips.
        Because I adjust each trip to suit those on it and because those on it, wish it - every trip is successful in
        its intentions. To have an Adventure with like minded folks, to return with a story to tell, to wish for more of
        the same.</p>
      <p>So, a grading system is not really neccesary.</p>
      <h4>Canada</h4>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Temagami</li>
        <li>Algonquin</li>
        <li>Crown Land / Nastawgan Routes</li>
        <li><em>Where do you want to go..?</em></li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Expeditions are based loosely around various trip durations. 10 days, 14 days or longer bespoke trips.</p>
      <p>Almost all itineries are more traditional journey's from lake to lake utilising interlinking portage trails.
        These journey's are as difficult, easy, long or relaxed as you want them to be. Generally all trips will spend
        time journeing for a few days with either a full rest day or a short day every few days.</p>
      <p>Unless the weather is extremely inclement or there is a Fire Ban in force, all cooking is done on open fires.
        Food is either fresh for the first few days or dehydrated meals specially prepared by the outfitters. There is
        an option to buy/pack our own food also.</p>
      <p>Once you arrive at the outfitters all equipment, food and shuttles are provided in the final costs. Travel to
        and from the point of entry into Canada and the outfitters plus any associated costs is at the expense of each
        client.</p>
      <h4>Scotland</h4>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Western Isles &amp; Outer Hebrides</li>
        <li>Other Areas</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Expeditions are between 4 and 10 days, or bespoke.</p>
      <p>The scottish trips tend to be a bit more challenging overall. Quite often heading into areas that are less
        frequented by canoeists, involving sea crossings or coastal journey's along committing shorelines, rounding
        exposed headlands. There is a strong possibility of having to sit out the weather or sea state, even making a
        route reversal. This is where the adventure though lays.</p>
      <h3>Costs</h3>
      <p>Costs of each trip are dependent on the location and duration, a typical outfitting cost in Canada is approx
        CDN$140/person/day - (Equipment, Food, Shuttles). Costs for trips in Scotland & France take into account that
        participants are self-sufficient in all their requirements. Guiding costs are Â£250/day/group, this cost is fixed
        (until 2025) and shared amongst <b>ALL</b> group participants, plus <b>ALL</b> Guide expenses (this will be
        notified to participants).</p>
      <em>Wilderness Canoe aim to be fair in pricing. We want folks to be able to experience places without
        breaking the bank. <p>Therefore:<br /> Wilderness Canoe keep external costs to their actual cost to
          us;<br />Wilderness Canoe
          charge a fair rate for our services;<br /> Wilderness Canoe are transparent with any expenses passed onto
          clients.</p></em>
