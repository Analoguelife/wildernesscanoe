        <p class="lead"><b>Wilderness Canoe</b> are based in Scotland, although our expeditions focus mostly on <b>Canada</b> more particularly Ontario.  Wilderness Canoe have been running trips to various locations within Ontario since 2016, and in Scotland since 2003.</p>
        <p>Since Covid, we made a return to both Temagami and Algonquin in 2022 with clients. During 2023, we were originally going to be based in France for a while and this would have impacted the available time for us to run trips this year. However life changes and we are now in a position to commence trips during the period - mid August until early October.</p>

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>For those with a vision to be in wild spaces where reflection, observation of the surrounding world, cooperation in
        learning and helping each other along the canoeing journey can be experienced. We challenge clients to explore and
        question their canoeing skills, their knowledge of the world around them, and their relationship to canoeing.</p>        
        <p>Wilderness Canoe hope to encourage a return to a deeper appreciation of traditional values believing this to be a vital
        part of true education/experience/exploration, and thus help to nourish the human spirit in an impoverished age. Through
        this exploration, you will achieve a strong sense of personal accomplishment and growth under our relaxed supervision.</p>        
        <p>Learn new skills, Experience true nature, Advance to higher levels; no one offers the same diversity and depth.</p>        
        <p>Wilderness Canoe journeys are contextual, we believe people need to experience activities, nature, wildness and
        ourselves to reconnect, stay connected and thrive.</p>        
        <p>Contextual Learning allows for an environment where we can explore our surroundings, gain connection through involvement
        and multi-sensory feelings; practise skills within context; return to simple pleasures and a slower pace of life. Your
        experience will be in this fully participatory expedition environment; let us help you achieve your aspirations and
        dreams.</p>        
        <p>Wilderness Canoe have now led innumerable trips here in the UK, coached at symposia in the UK, France and in the Canada,
        led trips to Norway, Sweden, France and Canada as well as in Scotland.</p>        
        <p>We think of ourselves as the Canoeists Canoer.</p>        
        <p>Spending time somewhere that we have used the canoe to access, sitting watching the stars or the sunrise, smelling the
        waft of fresh coffee brewing on the campfire, slowing down, reflecting and relishing the disconnect from your everyday
        world and the new found connectedness to this world.</p>
